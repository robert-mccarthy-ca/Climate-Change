# Climate-Change
Where I put anything climate related.

So far there's only one, why-1-5-degrees-c-mattered.ipynb. This is my attempt to play a little with pyplot and convey some simple information to people using easily verifiable information and show them how to modify it to their location. My attempt to show just how hard we're careening off a cliff into radical environmental carnage.
