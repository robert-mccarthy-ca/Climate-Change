We've passed the critical 1.5°C threshold, and it's not just a number—it's the tipping point beyond which the devastating effects of climate change start to snowball. **This notebook is my attempt to channel that frustration into something constructive: understanding.**\n\nWe’re going to dive into why limiting global warming to 1.5°C isn’t just important—it’s *essential* for our survival. Whether you’re someone who struggles with graphs or a scientist familiar with climate models, the data will speak for itself. For those unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, don’t worry! The format allows us to combine text with executable code. Feel free to skip the code, but if you’re interested, it’s there for you to explore.\n\nThe Paris Agreement set the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C. But why is that number so crucial? I’m going to show, using official climate data (with links), why this is one of the most critical numbers in human history.\n\n## What Does 1.5°C Really Mean?\n\nYou’ve probably heard about the impacts of a 1°C, 1.5°C, or even 2°C change. But what does that really mean in terms of the planet? A 1°C shift might sound small, but on a global scale, it’s monumental. Let’s break this down and explore the true impact.\n\n## How Much Have We Already Warmed?\n\nTo put this in perspective, we’ll look at data from four cities across Canada:\n\n- **Sault Ste. Marie** (Northern Ontario, my hometown)\n- **Toronto** (Southern Ontario, warmer than Sault Ste. Marie)\n- **Whitehorse** (Capital of the Yukon)\n- **Yellowknife** (Capital of the Northwest Territories)\n\nWe’ll use data from [WeatherStats](https://www.weatherstats.ca) and global temperature data from the [University of Maine's Climate Reanalyzer](https://climatereanalyzer.org/).\n\nOur goal is to visualize:\n\n- **Dates** on one axis\n- **Rolling averages of annual temperatures** on the other\n\nBy using rolling averages, we’ll cut through the noise of seasonal fluctuations and focus on the long-term climate trends. Let’s graph the data and take a hard look at how much change has already occurred. The x-axis will represent the dates, and the y-axis will show the rolling average of temperatures over the past year.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport json\n\ndef process_hourly_data(hourly_file):\n    \"\"\"\n    Process hourly temperature data to calculate daily averages and rolling averages.\n\n    Args:\n        hourly_file (str): filename with hourly temperature data in CSV format.\n\n    Returns:\n        DataFrame: Processed daily data with 'date' and 'rolling_average_temp' columns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the hourly data\n    hourly_data = pd.read_csv(hourly_file, low_memory=False)\n    \n    # Convert 'unixtime' to 'date' and calculate daily average temperature\n    hourly_data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(hourly_data['unixtime'], unit='s').dt.date\n    daily_data = hourly_data.groupby('date')['temperature'].mean().reset_index()\n    \n    return hourly_data, daily_data\n\ndef process_rolling_daily(daily_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the rolling average temperature over a 365-day window.\n\n    Args:\n        daily_data (DataFrame): DataFrame with 'date' and 'temperature' columns.\n\n    Returns:\n        DataFrame: DataFrame with 'date' and 'rolling_average_temp' columns.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = daily_data.copy()\n    result['rolling_average_temp'] = daily_data['temperature'].rolling(window=365).mean()\n    result = result.dropna(subset=['rolling_average_temp'])\n    \n    return result\n\ndef process_global_temperature_json(json_file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Process global temperature data from a JSON file to calculate daily averages and rolling averages.\n\n    Args:\n        json_file_path (str): Path to the JSON file containing global temperature data.\n\n    Returns:\n        DataFrame: Processed global temperature data with 'date' and 'rolling_average_temp' columns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Load global temperature data from JSON\n    with open(json_file_path, 'r') as file:\n        global_temperature_data = json.load(file)\n    \n    # Transform the JSON into a DataFrame\n    rows = []\n    for year_data in global_temperature_data:\n        year = year_data[\"name\"]\n        daily_temps = year_data[\"data\"]\n        for day, temp in enumerate(daily_temps, start=1):\n            rows.append({\"Year\": year, \"Day\": day, \"Temperature\": temp})\n    \n    global_temperature_df = pd.DataFrame(rows)\n    \n    # Clean the data (filter nulls, handle non-leap years)\n    global_temperature_df = global_temperature_df[global_temperature_df['Temperature'].notnull()]\n    global_temperature_df = global_temperature_df[~global_temperature_df['Year'].str.contains('-')]\n    \n    # Convert 'Year' and 'Day' to 'date' and calculate rolling average\n    global_temperature_df['date'] = (pd.to_datetime(global_temperature_df['Year'], format='%Y') + \n                                      pd.to_timedelta(global_temperature_df['Day'] - 1, unit='D')).dt.date\n    global_daily = global_temperature_df[['date', 'Temperature']].rename(columns={'Temperature': 'average_daily_temp'})\n    \n    global_daily['rolling_average_temp'] = global_daily['average_daily_temp'].rolling(window=365, min_periods=365).mean()\n    global_daily = global_daily.dropna(subset=['rolling_average_temp'])\n    global_daily = global_daily[['date', 'rolling_average_temp']]\n    \n    return global_daily\n\ndef plot_rolling_averages(dataframe_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Plots the 365-day rolling average temperatures for multiple cities and global average.\n    \n    Args:\n        dataframe_dict (dict): A dictionary where the keys are city names (strings) \n                               and the values are DataFrames containing 'date' and 'rolling_average_temp'.\n    \"\"\"\n    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n    plt.title(\"365-Day Rolling Average Temperatures\", fontsize=16)\n    \n    # Loop through each city and plot the data\n    for city, data in dataframe_dict.items():\n        color = color_mapping.get(city, \"#000000\")  # Default to black if city not in color_mapping\n        plt.plot(data['date'], data['rolling_average_temp'], label=city, color=color, alpha=0.7)\n    \n    # Add labels and grid\n    plt.xlabel(\"Date\", fontsize=14)\n    plt.ylabel(\"365-Day Rolling Average Temperature (°C)\", fontsize=14)\n    plt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotate date labels for better readability\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.grid(True)\n    plt.tight_layout()  # Ensures everything fits without overlapping\n    plt.show()\n\n# Deterministic color mapping for each city and global average\ncolor_mapping = {\n    \"Sault Ste.

The global average includes a lot of ocean temperatures, as the Earth is mostly covered by oceans.\n\n## Cleaning and Refining the Data\n\nThe data spans different time periods across cities, and in order to make meaningful comparisons, we need consistency. Some cities have more data than others, and we must focus on the years where all cities' data overlap. To achieve this, we’ll trim the datasets to the years where we have complete information across all locations.\n\nNext, we’ll calculate the **average temperatures** for each city during the **first 20 years** of the trimmed dataset (from **July 31, 1962**, to **July 30, 1982**).

Marie and Toronto are both located along the Great Lakes and experience similar temperature fluctuations, Sault Ste. Marie lies about 300 km farther north. This results in a temperature difference of just 3°C, but that small shift has a massive impact on what crops can thrive—apples and plums in Sault Ste.

Sault Ste. Marie ended the year warmer than Toronto during the baseline period, which is troubling. Yellowknife has warmed to nearly the same level as Whitehorse, but the most concerning shift is happening in Whitehorse. It’s crossing a critical threshold—its average temperature is no longer below freezing.\n\n### The Melting of Permafrost\n\nWhen temperatures remain below zero on average, the ground stays frozen at certain depths, never fully thawing. This is how permafrost forms—it freezes deeper than it melts. However, when temperatures consistently rise above zero, the frozen ground will eventually thaw. It won’t happen all at once, like glaciers, because permafrost is thick. But, like glaciers, if the temperature stays warm enough, it will melt over time.\n\n**The permafrost has started to melt.**\n\nThis is catastrophic news. It’s *apocalyptically bad news*. Let’s take a deeper look at why this is such a dire situation.\n\nFor this, we’ll keep things relatively straightforward. We'll generate a basic histogram showing the CO2 levels in the atmosphere: when records began, today’s levels, how much is stored in the permafrost, and how much we’ll have if all of it melts. \n\nTo get the first two, I’ll retrieve the CO2 data from the Mauna Loa Observatory (available at [co2.earth](https://www.co2.earth/22-co2-now/121-mauna-loa-co2)) and convert it into tons. For the third data point, I’ll look up the amount of CO2 stored in the permafrost—it’s not a time series, so I’ll just gather that value. Since CO2 levels, like temperatures, follow a seasonal cycle, I’ll calculate rolling averages to smooth out the noise.\n\nLet’s load the data and check it out.

Now, let's convert this into tons.\n\nNext, we’ll compare these numbers to the carbon stored in the permafrost, which holds around 1,460 to 1,600 gigatons of organic carbon. When this carbon decomposes, it turns into either carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4), depending on the conditions—aerobic or anaerobic, respectively. If it all decomposed aerobically, it would release about 5,360 to 5,870 gigatons of CO2.\n\nGiven that methane is roughly 85 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas over a 20-year period, we can hope it decomposes into CO2 rather than methane. Unfortunately, it looks like that’s exactly what will happen.\n\nIt’s important to note that the ocean plays a role in this process. It absorbs about 25-30% of excess CO2, with the remaining CO2 staying in the atmosphere.\n\nFor the sake of this scenario, let’s use the lowest-end estimates—5,360 gigatons of CO2—which assumes the best-case situation: all the permafrost melts and decomposes as carbon dioxide, with no methane produced, and the ocean absorbs 30% of the CO2.\n\nThis is the absolute best-case scenario if the permafrost melts and the carbon is released into the atmosphere.
